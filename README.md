## Magazine Style
According to Segel and Heer, the magazine style of narrative visualization is, "an image embedded in a page of text (“magazine style”) has only a single frame" (7). They further elaborate by saying and also recommending ways to take the static element of magazine style for better engagement:
```
the “magazine style” genre is the most common
genre for static visualizations, but has not been as richly utilized
with interactive visualizations. How might multiple media be better
integrated for storytelling? For example, a martini glass structure for
a visualization may be weaved into a text story: static images might
first support the text and introduce the visualization; an embedded interactive
visualization may appear later, perhaps with links in the text
setting visualization parameters to highlight points made within the
prose; finally, at the article’s end, the visualization may open up to
enable free exploration. (9)

#### Wireframe
![Wireframe of Magazine style for Job Satisfaction vs Monthly Hours Worked](/images/magazinestyle.jpg "Wireframe")

This wireframe interprets a data set that contains information of Job Satisfaction and Monthly Hours Worked for different departments in a company. The wireframe takes a static graphic and incorporates interaction by: allowing hovering over data points, filtering the data points by departments, and clicking on dense data points to. 

#### Elements
##### Visual Narrative Elements
Consistent Visual Platform - Where "changing only the content within the frame while leaving the general layout of the visual elements intact" will be important in orienting the user to the graphic (3). Because the graphic has a set scales on it's axis, keeping these from animating will be important for the user when exploring the data points (hover, filter by department, reading annotations).

Close Up - This will be useful when there are dense clusters of data points. The user will be able to click on an area and see a close up of the data points in the area. The close up will be displayed as a pop up as to not change the scales on the axis.

Feature Distinction - Because the data points will also encode categorical information (departments) they will have colors specific to a category with a legend stating which color pertains to which category. This will help the user identify which data point belongs to which category to identify patterns.

##### Narrative Structures
Random Access - The user will have random access throughout the graphic. This will allow open exploration of the data points.

Hover Highlighting/Details - The user can explore individual data points by hovering over them and learning more about the specific data point.

Filtering - The user can filter which data points they can view, by only viewing specific categories (departments in this case). This will allow the user to see patterns within a specific category.

Annotations - There are many data points by adding an annotation to extreme points it draws attention to these data points. In the annotation we can add context to the particular data point. 

Introductory Text - This text will orient the user to the context of the graphic. The user can then explore the graphic freely.

Summary - Card summaries of the data points will be provided to the user to sum up the key points of the data.
